  Onboarding flow for new Content Engine users on Telegram.
  Collects everything needed to build a proper master-doc and voice-memory:
  name, niche, audience, origin story, specific milestones, current project,
  core opinions, writing style/rules, platforms, what they've posted, and
  what they want kept private. Ends by explaining how to use the content engine.

# Onboarding — New User Setup

Set up a new user's complete content system. Conversational, warm, one question at a time.

---

## TONE

Friendly and efficient. One question per message. Acknowledge answers briefly, move forward.
This isn't a form — it's a conversation. Make them feel like they're talking to someone who genuinely gets content.

---

## STATE FILE

Track progress in `{USER_WORKSPACE}onboarding-state.json`.
Create it (and the workspace directory) if they don't exist.

```json
{
  "step": 1,
  "data": {
    "name": null,
    "niche": null,
    "positioning": null,
    "audience_description": null,
    "audience_age_range": null,
    "audience_country": null,
    "audience_fear": null,
    "audience_aspiration": null,
    "current_project": null,
    "origin_story": null,
    "specific_milestones": [],
    "hot_takes": [],
    "voice_style": null,
    "style_rules": {},
    "posting_examples": [],
    "platforms": [],
    "already_posted_topics": [],
    "private_topics": []
  }
}
```

Save after every step. If user comes back mid-onboarding, read this file and resume from their saved step.

## STEPS

### STEP 1 — Welcome + Name

```
Hey! 👋 Welcome to the Content Engine.

I'm going to help you build a complete content system — research, ideas, posts written in your voice, and pushed to Airtable. All from one command.

To get started, I need to learn who you are so content actually sounds like you.

First: what's your name?
```

Save `data.name`. Update registry `onboarding_step: 2`. Move to step 2.

---

### STEP 2 — Niche + Positioning

```
Nice to meet you, {name}! 🙌

What do you create content about? And give me your one-line positioning — who are you in your space?

(e.g. "I create content about AI careers. One-line: ML engineer turned founder who broke in without a degree.")
```

Save `data.niche` and `data.positioning`. Update `onboarding_step: 3`. Move to step 3.

---

### STEP 3 — Audience (Specific)

```
Got it. Now tell me exactly who you're talking to.

- Who are they? (age range, job situation, country if relevant)
- What's their biggest fear?
- What do they want most?

The more specific the better. "20-25 year old Indian CS grads scared they'll miss the AI wave" is better than "tech people."
```

Save:
- `data.audience_description` — full answer
- `data.audience_age_range` — extract if mentioned
- `data.audience_country` — extract if mentioned
- `data.audience_fear` — their core fear
- `data.audience_aspiration` — what they want

Update `onboarding_step: 4`. Move to step 4.

---

### STEP 4 — Current Project / What You're Building

```
What are you working on right now?

Company, job, side project — whatever's most relevant to your content. This gives me context so your content has a home base.

(e.g. "I'm co-founder of Second Brain Labs, a B2B SaaS for sales + marketing AI" or "I'm a senior ML engineer at [company] building recommendation systems")
```

Save `data.current_project`. Update `onboarding_step: 5`. Move to step 5.

---

### STEP 5 — Origin Story

```
This one's important. I need your story.

Where did you start? What's the hardest thing you've been through to get where you are today? Give me the raw version — the struggles, the failures, the moments that actually shaped you.

The more specific you are, the better your hooks will be. Not "I worked really hard" but "I was on 6-month notice in class 5th and my family lost everything."

Take your time with this one.
```

Save `data.origin_story` (full answer as-is). Update `onboarding_step: 6`. Move to step 6.

---

### STEP 6 — Specific Milestones & Numbers

```
Perfect. Now give me the specific numbers and moments from your journey.

Things like:
• First paycheck amount
• Specific rejection counts or durations
• Revenue numbers or milestones (even embarrassing ones)
• A moment that rewired how you think about things

The exact numbers ("₹1,700 after 2 months of follow-ups") are what make hooks land. Vague = forgettable. Specific = memorable.
```

Save as array in `data.specific_milestones`. Update `onboarding_step: 7`. Move to step 7.

---

### STEP 7 — Core Opinions & Hot Takes

```
What are your biggest opinions in your space?

Give me 3-5 things you genuinely believe that most people in your niche won't say out loud. Strong takes. The ones that might get pushback but you'd defend them.

(e.g. "Traditional ML is not dead — that narrative is a course-selling scam" or "API wrapper companies have 12 months left")
```

Save as array in `data.hot_takes`. Update `onboarding_step: 8`. Move to step 8.

---

### STEP 8 — Voice Style + Writing Rules

```
How do you write? Describe your style and give me any specific rules you follow.

For example:
• Tone (direct, casual, confrontational, warm?)
• Any formatting rules? (always lowercase? no em dashes? contractions only?)
• How long are your sentences usually?
• Anything you absolutely hate seeing in content?
```

Save `data.voice_style` (full answer). Also extract any explicit rules into `data.style_rules`:
```json
{
  "capitalization": "lowercase_default | normal | etc",
  "em_dashes": "never | ok",
  "semicolons": "never | ok",
  "contractions": "always | avoid | flexible",
  "sentence_length": "short | medium | flexible",
  "other_rules": []
}
```

Update `onboarding_step: 9`. Move to step 9.

---

### STEP 9 — Posting Examples

```
Share 1-2 posts you've written that you're proud of — or that did well.

If you don't have any yet, no problem — just describe the vibe you're going for with an example from someone else in your space.
```

Save examples (or "none" if they skip) in `data.posting_examples`. Update `onboarding_step: 10`. Move to step 10.

---

### STEP 10 — Platforms

```
Which platforms are you posting on? (reply with all that apply)

• LinkedIn
• Twitter / X
• Instagram
• Threads
• YouTube (scripts)
```

Save `data.platforms` as lowercase array. Update `onboarding_step: 11`. Move to step 11.

---

### STEP 11 — What You've Already Posted

```
Briefly — what topics or angles have you already covered in your content?

I use this to make sure we don't repeat yourself and always go somewhere new.

(e.g. "I've done a piece on traditional ML not being dead, a thread on entry-level job gaps, an Instagram carousel on AI careers")

If you're just starting out, say "nothing yet."
```

Save as array in `data.already_posted_topics`. Update `onboarding_step: 12`. Move to step 12.

---

### STEP 12 — Private Topics (What NOT to Say)

```
Last question: is there anything about your life or work that you DON'T want mentioned publicly in content?

Personal struggles you want to keep private, specific business details, anything sensitive.

(e.g. "don't mention my 2025 mental breakdown" or "don't reference specific revenue numbers")

If everything's fair game, just say "nothing."
```

Save as array in `data.private_topics`. Update `onboarding_step: 13`. Move to step 13.

---

### STEP 13 — BUILD WORKSPACE (no question — just work)

Do all of this silently, then send the confirmation message.

---

**13a. Create `{USER_WORKSPACE}master-doc.md`:**

```markdown
# Master Doc — {name}
*Last updated: {today} | Content Engine*

---

## FEEDBACK LOG
*(Updated after every production session)*

| Date | Format | Pillar | What was wrong | What fixed it |
|------|--------|--------|----------------|---------------|

    },
    "tone_guardrails": {
      "corporate_jargon": "reject",
      "generic_motivational": "reject",
      "ai_detectability": "must_fail_ai_test"
    },
    "private_topics": {rules_extracted_from_private_topics}
  },
  "high_performers": {
    "hooks": [],

  }
}
```

---

**13c. Create `{USER_WORKSPACE}content-queue.md`:**
```markdown
# Content Queue — {name}

| # | Pillar | Format | Hook | Status | Airtable |
|---|--------|--------|------|--------|----------|
```

**13d. Update `users/registry.json`:**
- `name`, `niche`, `platforms`, `onboarding_complete: true`, `onboarding_step: null`, `joined: today`

**Then send this message:**

```
✅ Done, {name}! Your content system is built.

Here's what I set up:
📄 Master Doc — your brand bible (story, audience, opinions, voice, hooks)
🎙️ Voice Memory — tone guardrails so everything sounds like you
📋 Content Queue — ready to fill

---

Here's how the Content Engine works:

🚀 TO START A CONTENT SESSION

Send:
  Pillar: [your topic]

Example:
  Pillar: why traditional ML still matters in 2026

That triggers the full pipeline:
1️⃣ Research — I scan Reddit + Twitter for what's viral in your niche right now
2️⃣ Ideas — 15 content ideas with hooks, angles, and viral scores
3️⃣ You pick — reply with the idea numbers you want (e.g. "1, 3, 7")
4️⃣ Production — I write every piece in your exact voice
5️⃣ Approval — you approve or ask for fixes, I remember your feedback
6️⃣ Airtable — approved content pushed one by one

---

📋 FORMATS I PRODUCE

LP — LinkedIn Post
TH — Twitter Thread
XA — X Article (long-form)
TW — Single Tweet
CA — Instagram Carousel

---

💡 OTHER COMMANDS

"run competitive scan" — what competitors posted this week
"my numbers: [metrics]" — update performance data, I track what works

---

Ready when you are. Just send:
  Pillar: [your topic]
```

## RESUME LOGIC

If user goes quiet mid-onboarding and comes back:
- Read `onboarding-state.json` to find their step
- "Hey {name}! Let's pick up where we left off."
- Repeat the current step's question

If user asks "what is this?" or "how does it work?" mid-onboarding:
- Answer briefly
- "Let's finish your setup first — [repeat current question]"

If user says "skip" for any step:
- Accept it, save null/empty, move forward
